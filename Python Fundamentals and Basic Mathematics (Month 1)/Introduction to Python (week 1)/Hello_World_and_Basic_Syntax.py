""" The most basic Python program that prints text to the console. 
Python uses indentation (typically 4 spaces) 
to define code blocks instead of curly braces. """

print("Hello, World!")  # This is a comment

def example_function():
    # This 4-space indentation is mandatory
    print("Function executed")
