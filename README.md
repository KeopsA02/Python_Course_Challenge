# Python_Course_Challenge
Hello everyone, I'm Keops and I'm a mechatronics engineer. In this repository, I'll teach you everything about Python. I've divided the courses by month and week, so you can learn it in a 3-month challenge (you can adjust it to the time you need. Don't pressure yourself, enjoy this course!).
